# Pandas-Challenge
Deep dive into data analyzing standardized tests.

Calculate district summary 
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Calculate individual schol summary

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Using the data summary data calculate Top Performing and underperforming 
schools.

Calculate if there is an correlation between dollar spent on each kid affects the scores in reading and math
Calculate if school size matter 
Check which school type (Charter or Public) is performing better.

If you look at the data of Top performing schools, charter school is doing weel accross the board.

If you look at this table calculating school spending money on students

                  Average Math Score	Average Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing
Spending Ranges (Per Student)					
<$584	            83.46	83.93	93.46	96.61	90.37
$585-629	        81.90	83.16	87.13	92.72	81.42
$630-644	        78.52	81.62	73.48	84.39	62.86
$645-675	        77.00	81.03	66.16	81.13	53.53

You see there is no correlation between amount of money spent on each student.
and improvememnt in their scores.
The more money you spend the scores are lower accross the board.

                  Avg Math Score	Avg. Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing
School Size					
Small(<1000)	    83.821598	83.929843	93.550225	96.099437	89.883853
Medium(1000-2000)	83.374684	83.864438	93.599695	96.790680	90.621535
Large(2000-5000)	77.746417	81.344493	69.963361	82.766634	58.286003

As you can see the number of students matter. The larger the school district the scores are taking a beating. 
It would be really interesting to see the performance by size and by school type. The difference in size between 
District and Charter schools.
